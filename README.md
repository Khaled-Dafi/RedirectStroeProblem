Bussiness Problem: : In this problem, we'll explore a scenario where a startup website initially focused on selling books with the URL "/BookStore" decides to expand its product range to include mobile phones, games, and PCs. To accommodate this expansion, the website aims to update its URL structure to "/Store/Mobile," "/Store/Games," and "/Store/Books."
